/*
    (1)Write a function called halfNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), 
    divide it by 2, and return the result. It should log a string like "Half of 5 is 2.5.".

    (2)Write a function called squareNumber() that accepts one argument (a number), 
    square that number, and return the result. It should also log a string like "The result of squaring the number 3 is 9."

   (3) Write a function called percentOf() that accepts two numbers, figure out what percent 
    the first number represents of the second number, and return the result. It should log a string like "2 is 50% of 4."

   (4) Write a function called findModulus() that accepts two numbers. Within the function write a 
   statement that returns the modulus of the first and second parameters. It should log a string like "2 is the modulus of 4 and 10."
